## API Template

This project both serves as a template and as a reference for my future self in creating a new dotnetcore web API project.

This project uses the following libraries:

| Framework        | Purpose                       |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| NLog             | Logging                       |
| Swashbuckle      | API documentation and testing |
| xUnit            | Unit testing                  |
| NSubstitute      | Mocking library for testing   |
| FluentAssertions | Test assertions               |
